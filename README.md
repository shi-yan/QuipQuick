QuipQuick is a static blog generator targeting github page deployment. I used to use Hugo + PaperModX, but was bothered by two issues. One problem is related to math equation rendering. it only works on some equations, but not all. The other problem is related to figuring out the right path to put images in. intuitive locations might result in unloadable images when deployed.
