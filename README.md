QuipQuick is a static blog generator tailored for effortless deployment on GitHub Pages. While I previously utilized Hugo + PaperModX, I encountered two specific issues that led me to develop QuipQuick.

The first challenge revolves around math equation rendering in Hugo, which proved inconsistent. Some equations displayed correctly, while others faced issues. QuipQuick addresses this by ensuring reliable rendering for all mathematical expressions.

The second issue pertains to the complexity of determining the right path for images. Conventional approaches often result in image loading issues upon deployment. QuipQuick provides an intuitive solution, ensuring images are placed correctly and load seamlessly when your blog is live.
